                    <h3> Introduction </h3>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi! My name is Alex. I’m 25 and I live in Hanoi which is the capital of Vietnam.
                    Actually
                    I come from another city - Hatay, where I lived for eleven years, but five years ago, my dad decided
                    to
                    change his job, and we all moved to Warsaw. I have a sister – Maja. She is 18 and she had been to
                    USA
                    two years ago and now she studies law at the University of Warsaw. My dad works for a German
                    company. My
                    mom used to teatch at the University and now, she works as a computer analitist.

                    <h3> Interests </h3>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m interested in computer science, music, sport and fantasy literature. Computers
                    first
                    appered in my life when I was seven. Then I had got my first computer. It was Commodore 64 and I
                    remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world. I was playing it whenever I
                    could.
                    Then I had got my first PC. At first, I was just playing computer games, but some time later, I
                    noticed
                    that I could do a lot more things with the computer, for example programming. Now, I can already
                    programue in Pascal, C++ and HTML. I have my own site on the internet and I have done many
                    programues. I
                    hope that in the future I will get a job as a computer scientist.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m a major foody. I enjoy eating out alot, but not fancy places. Lots of small
                        restaurants have good quality food at a decent price. There is an app called 'Eat Club' offers
                        discounts
                        and specials at many infamous restaurants.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a special interest in black and white photos because I think they look more
