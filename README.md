Index Page.
I apply Bootstrap grid system into the navbar with 
        6 columns for the first element on the left and it expands to 12 when you when you reduce the screen size
        2 columns for each element on the right and they will jump to a new row when you reduce the screen size with 4 colums each
   I dont use bootstrap nav bar. It has an issue which is I cant align the text of the first element to center when it expands to 12 columns.
I also apply grid system to the content and make it responsive when reduce the screen size. the profile pic and 1st paragraph is on the same row with 3 and 9 columns respectively, will be 12 when reduce the screen size. The second paragraph takes up 12 columns.

Portfolio Page.
I recode the main content compared to the previous assignment and apply the grid system to it. 4 columns when lg size, 6 columns when medium and 12 columns when small. All pics are responsive.

Contact page.
I delete the old form and replace with a bootstrap form and make some editing. The bootstrap form is already responsive when reduce the screen size by default
